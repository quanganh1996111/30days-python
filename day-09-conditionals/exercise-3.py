# Get two numbers from the user using input prompt. If a is greater than b return a is greater than b, if a is less b return a is smaller than b, else a is equal to b. Output:
a=float(input('Nhap a bang: '))
b=float(input('Nhap b bang: '))
if a>b:
    print('a is greater than b')
elif a<b:
    print('a is smaller than b')
elif a==b:
    print('a is equal to b')
